# UnKlackEnder-Probe

UnKlackEnder Probe is for those who use kevinakasam's [KlackEnder-Probe](https://github.com/kevinakasam/KlackEnder-Probe) but are not satisfied with the performance of microswitch. It's a drop in replacement for the KlackEnder probe.

Inspired by [Unklicky](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky).
